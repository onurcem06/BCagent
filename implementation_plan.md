# Branding Creator Enhancements Plan

This plan outlines the steps to evolve the "Branding Creator" from a prototype into a more robust and professional branding tool.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The AI currently outputs JSON which is parsed directly into the store. We should decide if we want to allow users to **edit** these fields manually on the board or keep them AI-driven only.
> 
> [!TIP]
> Integrating an image generation API (like DALL-E 3 or Stability AI) would significantly enhance the "Presentation Mode" by showing actual brand visuals instead of just text prompts.

## Proposed Changes

### Core Logic & AI Stability
- **[MODIFY] [route.ts](file:///Users/onurcemarslan/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-onurcem@gmail.com/Diğer bilgisayarlar/Bilgisayarım/Aİ PROJECT/BRANDİNG CREATOR/app/api/chat/route.ts)**:
    - Tighten the system prompt to ensure JSON is always the final block.
    - Implement a "schema validation" step before returning the response to ensure the UI doesn't break.
- **[MODIFY] [DiscoveryChat.tsx](file:///Users/onurcemarslan/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-onurcem@gmail.com/Diğer bilgisayarlar/Bilgisayarım/Aİ PROJECT/BRANDİNG CREATOR/app/components/DiscoveryChat.tsx)**:
    - Improve error handling for JSON parsing.
    - Add a "Thinking" state that shows the strategic steps the AI is taking.

### Visual Identity & Board
- **[MODIFY] [BrandIdentityBoard.tsx](file:///Users/onurcemarslan/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-onurcem@gmail.com/Diğer bilgisayarlar/Bilgisayarım/Aİ PROJECT/BRANDİNG CREATOR/app/components/BrandIdentityBoard.tsx)**:
    - Add "Edit" buttons to each card in Strategy Mode to allow manual overrides.
    - Enhance "Presentation Mode" with more interactive elements.
    - **[NEW] BrandGuidePDF.tsx**: A new component or utility to generate a PDF summary of the brand.

### Feature Additions
- **[NEW] ImageGenerationService**: Create a backend route or service to call an image generation API using the prompts generated by the AI strategy.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run lint` to ensure no regressions in TypeScript/ESLint.
- Create a test script to verify the JSON extraction logic in `DiscoveryChat`.

### Manual Verification
1. **Interactive Test**: Start a brand discovery session, upload an inspiration image, and verify the board updates correctly.
2. **Export Test**: Click "Export" and verify the JSON (or future PDF) contains all current brand data.
3. **Mockup Test**: Switch to "Presentation Mode" and verify Macbook/Phone/Business Card previews accurately reflect the brand colors and typography.
